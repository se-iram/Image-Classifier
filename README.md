## üöÄ Features
- Trained ANN and CNN models on CIFAR-10 (10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).  
- Achieved **~67% test accuracy with CNN**, outperforming the ANN baseline.  
- Implemented evaluation using **classification reports and confusion matrices**.  
- Visualized sample predictions for better interpretability.

## üìå Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I:  
- Gained hands-on experience in **deep learning workflows** ‚Äî from dataset preprocessing to model deployment.  
- Learned the **importance of convolutional layers** in capturing spatial patterns compared to fully connected layers.  
- Strengthened skills in **data visualization and performance evaluation** using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Understood how **overfitting/underfitting** affects model performance and the role of optimization (SGD vs Adam).  
- Built confidence in **experimenting with hyperparameters**, architectures, and training strategies.  
- Developed a stronger foundation in **image processing and computer vision concepts**, aligning with my research interests.
